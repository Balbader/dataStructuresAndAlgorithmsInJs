# What is Big O

+ Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input
+ It is not meant to be an exact measurement
+ It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes
+ Instead, it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm or ***HOW*** the input grows

### Big O aims to answer the following :
    As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow ?

#### Important concepts:
    1. Growth is with respect to the input
    2. Always drop constants
    3. Worst case is **usually** the way we measure

1. The easiest way to tell the Big O complexity of anything is:
+ To look for loops that iterates over the input

2. We are not trying to get exact time of growth but to understand ***HOW*** input grows
