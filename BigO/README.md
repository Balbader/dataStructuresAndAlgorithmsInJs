# What is Big O

+ Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on iput
+ It is not meant to be an exact measurement
+ It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes
+ Instead, it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm

### Big O means to answer the following :
    + As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow ?


#### Important concepts:
    1. Growth is with respect to the input
    2. Always drop constants

1. The easiest way to tell the Big O complexity of anything is:
+ To look for loops that iterates over the input

2. We are not trying to get exact time of growth but to understand ***HOW*** input grows
